## Group Web-buying app
To successfully test out the web application, you will need to have three accounts in your MetaMask wallet. Each account should have at least 0.1 GoerliETH and 10 USDC tokens.

For the USDC tokens, you can head to [this](https://usdcfaucet.com/) faucet and obtain them over the Ethereum Goerli network. 
To ensure the tokens show up in your MetaMask accounts, you should [import the token](https://developers.circle.com/developer/docs/usdc-on-testnet).

For the GoerliETH tokens, you can obtain them from several faucets like:
* [Alchemy's Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/) - 0.2 GoerliETH every 24 hours, needs an Alchemy account
* [QuickNode's Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli) - 0.1 to 1 GoerliETH every 12 hours
* [Goerli PoW Faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/) - up to 1.5 GoerliETH but requires mining work to be performed by your device.
